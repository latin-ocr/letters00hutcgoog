To rna Enrunon Tanna

Surroivws Tnauounuua Sir, is a person of great
merit and learning, as well as of noble birth. Ι was
so much pleased with histum and manners, that Ι
long since made him one of my intimates; and my
affection for him still increased the more Ι discovered
of his character. Two reasons concur to make the
privilege which the law grants to those who have
three children,⁶⁶ extremely necessary to him; he is
legatee to several of his friendS,l and has had ill
success in his marriage. Those advantages therefore
which nature has denied to him, he hopes to obtain
from your goodness, by means of my intercession.
Ι am thoroughly sensible, Sir, of the value of the
favour Ι am asking; but Ι know I am making this
request to one whose gracious compliauce with
all my desires 1 have amply experienced. How
passionately l wish to obtain this favour, you will
judge by my thus requesting it in my absence, which
I should not have done, had it been a point wherein
Ι am only commonly solicitous

Tuaraiv ro Pnrwr

You cannot but know, my dear Pliny, how reserved
Ι am in granting favours of this kind, having fre-
quently declared in the senate, that I had not ex-

⁶By the Lex Papia Poppaea (vii. 16, nota) childless
persons forfeited one half of every legacy they received.
