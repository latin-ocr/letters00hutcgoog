rate public opinion! Whether rightly or not, it
does not concern me to determine; Ido not invIte
the public to my recitals but only a limited and
select audience consisting of persons whom Ι respect
and trust, in fine, to whom I pay the attention due
to each as an individual, while I stand in awc of
them as a collective body. What Cicero says of
composing, in my opinIon, applies to this awe:
“Fear is the most rigid critic lmagInable.” The
mere thought of reciting, the enteriug an assembly,
the fact that we turn pale, shudder, and look about
us there—all these are so many aids to emendation.
I cannot, therefore, repent of a practice whichl
have found exceedingly beneficial; and am sofar
from being discouraged by the tittle·tattle of yonder
criticasters‚ that I beg you would point out some
method of correction, which 1 may add to thoseI
have described. For nothing can satisfy my zeal for

per-fection. I reflect what a serious thing it is to
place a work in the hands of the public; and l

cannot but be persuaded that you should revise
repeatedly‚ and in consultation with numerous
advisere, a piece that you wish to be universally aud
sor ever admired. Farewell.

To Caninius

You ask my advice in what manner you shall
settle the sum of money, which you have presented
to our fellow townsmen for an annual feast, so as to
secure the just application of it after your death.
