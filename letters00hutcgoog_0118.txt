our excellent prince and father of his country has
desired, at the instance of Pallas, to have that clause
of the' decree rescinded which assigns him fifteen
million sesterces out of the treasury; the Senate
declares that although they had gladly and justly set
about decreeing that sumto Pallas, amongst other
honourS, on account of his fidelity and diligence; yet ·
even in this matter they obey the will of their
sovereign, which they think can never be combated

his own honours, and refusing fifteen million sesterces

insignia as below them. lmagine Caesar obeying
the treaties, or rather the commands, of his freedman
in the sace of the Senate (for a freedman's request
tobis patron becomes a command when he delivers it
from a seat .in that Housel'). lmagine the Senate
declaring all the time that it had willingly and
justly designed, among other honours, to vote Pallas
this sum: and that it would have persevered
but for its obedience to the will of the Emperor,

. which it was impious to oppose on any point. Did it

need then the obsequiousness of the Senate and his
own modesty to prevent Pallas from carrying off
fifteen millions out of the treasury? And was it in
this case, of all others, that the Senate would have
been disobedient, if they had thought it lawful to
be so in any?

And now, perhaps, you think you are got to the
end? But waita bit ; here is something still grander
for you: “ ann wnnnms rr rs sxrnnrunr, that the
