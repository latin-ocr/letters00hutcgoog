BOOK Vll. xxvii

ior him in the fore-*part of the house, and aster
calling for a light, together with his pen and
tabletS, he directed all his people to retire within.
But that hismind might not, for want of employ-
ment, be open to the vain terrors of imaginary
noises and apparitione, he applied himself to writing
with all his faculties. The first part of the night
passed with usual silence, then began the clanking
of iron letters3 however, he neither lilted up his
eyeS, nor laid down his pen, but closed his ears by
concentrating his attention. The noise increased
and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door,
and at last iu the chamber. He looked round and
saw the apparition exactly as it had been described
· to him: it stood before him, beckoning with the
linger. Athenodorus made a sign with his hand
that it should wait a little, and bent again to his
writing, but the ghost rattling its chains over his
head as he wrote, he looked round and saw it
beckoning as before. Upon this he immediately .
took up his lamp and followed it. The ghost slowly
stalked along, as if eucumbered with its chains;
and having turned into the courtyard of the house,
suddenly vanished. Athenodorus being thus
deserted, marked the spot with a handful of grass
aud leaves. The next day he went to the
magistrates and advised them to order that spot
to be dug up. There they found bones commingled
and intertwincd with chains3 for the body had
mouldered away by long lying in the ground,
leaving them bare, and corroded by the letters.
The boues were collected, and buried at the public
expense; and aster the ghost was thus duly laid the
house was haunted no more.
