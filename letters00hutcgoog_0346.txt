loeus, revenues and expenditure of Apamea, the
citizens replied they were all extremely willing l
should inspect the accounts of the colony, but never-
theless no Proconsul had ever yet perused them, as
they had a privilege (and that of very ancient date)

a memorial of their assertions‚ together with the
authorities they cited, which l transmit to you

contains several things foreign to the question. Ι
beg you would honour me with your commands, how
l am to act in this allaim for I would not wilIIngly be
thought either to exceed or fall short of my commis-
sron.
