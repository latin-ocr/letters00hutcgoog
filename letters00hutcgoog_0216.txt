severally. lt is surprising with what attention, with
what applausel was heard hy those who just before
were exclaiming against me; such a wonderful
conversion was wrought either by the importance of
the affair, the successful progress of the speech, or
the resolution of the advocate. After l had finished,
Veiento began to reply3 not a soul would hear him ;
the general clamour raised against him was so over-
powering that he was reduced to saying, “I hope,
my lords, you will not oblige me to implore the
assistance of the Tribunesff’a Immediately the
Tribune Murena cried out, “ You have my leave,
most illustrious Veiento, to proceed.’' But still the
uproar was renewed. In the interval the Consul put
the question severally to the rest, and having taken
a division, dismissed the Senate, leaving Veiento
in the midst, still attempting to speak. He
made great complaints of this affront (as he
called it) applying the following lines of Homer to
himself:

“ Great perils, father, wait th’ unequal frght3
These younger champions will oppress thy might.”

There was scarce a man in the House that did not
embrace and kiss me, and vie in loading me with
praises. They extolled me because, at the risk of
exciting private animosities, l had revived the
eustom so long disused, of consulting the Senate in
the interest of the publicl’3 in fine, because l had
wiped off that reproach which was thrown upon the
Senate by the other orders of citizens that
while severe towards the rest of the community,
it let its own members escape its justice by a sort of
mutual connivance.
