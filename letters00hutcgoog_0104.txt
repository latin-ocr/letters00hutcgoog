BOOK VIII. ii

merchants, who were eager to purchase it, encour-
aged by the price it then bore, and what it was
probable it would rise t0; however they were
disappoiuted in theIr expectations. To have made
the same abatement to them all, would have been
the easy, but not the equitable, course. Now the

noblest part, according to my estimate, is to pursue
justice in one’s domestic as well as public conduct3
in minute as in great affairs; and in our own, as well
as in other men’sconcerns¹ For if “all sius are
equal‚’' a so are all meritorious actions

Accordingly, I remitted to all in general one-
eighth purt 01 1110 price they had agreed to give me,

that none “without my largesse might depart'';
next, I made separate provision for those who had
Invested large sums in their purchase3 since they
had not only contributed more to my profit, but lost
more heavily. To those, therefore, who had bought
to the value of more than ten thousand sesterces, I
remitted (over and beside the general and, so to
speak, public eighth) a tenth part of what they had
paid above that sum. I don't know whether I
express nryself clearly enough; 30 I will set out my
reckoning more plainly. Suppose a man had pur-
chased 10 the value of fifteen thousand 303101003, 110
got back one-eighth part of that amount, plus
one-tenth 01 five thousand sesterces

BesideS, considering that some had paid over
either large or small instalments of the purchase-
money, whiIst others had paid nothiug; I thought it
would be not at all fair to favour with the same
remission those who had discharged their debt in
varying proportione To those therefore who had
made any paymentS, I further returned a tenth part
