BOOK Vll. i.-ii

my physician offered me something to drink; Ι put
out my hand, bade him feel my pulse, and returned
the cup, though it was just at my lips. AlterwardS,
when Ι was preparing to go into the bath, twenty
days from the first attack of my illness, perceiving
on a sudden the physicians whispering together, Ι
inquired what they were saying. They replied‚ Ι
might possibly bathe with safety‚ however, they were
not without some suspicion of hazard. “What
need,” said Ι, “of doing it at all?'' And thus
with great complacency, Ι gave up the expected
pleasure of bathing, and abstained from the bath
with the same inward and outward composure Ι was
going to enter it. Ι mention this, not only in order
to enforce my advice by example, but also that this
letter may be a sort of pledge binding me to
' persevere in the same abstinence for the future.
Farewell.

To J usrus

Anu you not inconsistent with yourself, when you
assure me you have no intermission from business
and yet at the same time express an earnest desire
to see my works; upon which even the idle will
scarce bestow some of their useless hours? Ι will
not then break in upon your affairs during this busy
summer season; but when the return of winter shall
make it reasonable to suppose that your eveningS,
at least„ may be disengaged‚ Ι will look over my
trilles for something worth showing you. ln the
meanwhile, Ι shall be well satisfied, if my letters are
not troublesome‚ as Ι suspect they are, and therefore
shorten them. Farewell.
