Arrun having experienced, Sir, in Gabius BassuS, ·
Prefect of the Pontio shore, the greatest integrity,
honour and vigilance, as well as the most particular
respect to myself, I cannot refuse him my best wishes

To run Eurauou Turrru

l wuuuuv recommend Fabius Valens, who learned
a soldier’s duty under you; to which training it is
owing that he merits the honour of your favour.
The soldiery and the people here, who have had full
experience of his justice and humanity, endeavour
to rival each other in that glorious testimony they
give of him, as well in publicas in private; and l
notiiy this with all the sincerity you have a right to
expect from me.
