me know your decision. lt will be time enough for
you to exact fulfilment of private undertakings with
regard to parts of the theatre, when the main
building is finished. These paltry Greeks, l know,
have a loible for Gymnasia; hence, perhaps, the
citizens of Nicaea have been somewhat too ambitious

which they have placed, it seems, in · a very
improper situation. As there is no province that is
not furnished with architects of skill and ingenuity,
you cannot possibly be in want of one ; pray do not
imagine it is your quickest way to get them from

lholme, for it is usually from Greece that they come
