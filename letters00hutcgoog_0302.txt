To rna Enranon Tanis

Tuouon l am well assured, Sir, that you, who
never forget any opportunity of exerting your
generosity, are not unmindsul of the request Ι
lately made you; yet since you have frequently,
among many other instances of your indulgence,
permitted me to repeat my solicitations to you, I do
so now on behalf of Accius Sura3 and I earnestly

beseech you to honour him with the Praetorship, ·

which is at present vacant. Though his ambition is
extremely moderate, yet the quality of his birth,
the inflexible integrity which he has shewn in a
fortune below mediocrity, and, above all, the
happiness of your reign, which emboldens citizens
of conscious virtue to claim the indulgence of your
favour, prompta him to hope he may experience it in
this instance.
