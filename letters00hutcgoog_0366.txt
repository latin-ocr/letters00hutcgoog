Tnnrnu ro Purus

Ir is possible Domitian might be ignorant of the
position of Archippus when he wrote letters so much
to that philosopher's honour. However, it is more
agreeable to my disposition to suppose that Prince's
intervention actually restored him to his former
situation3 especially since he so often had even the
honour of a statue decreed to him by thosea who
could not be ignorant of the sentence which the
Proconsul Paulus pronounced upon him. Butl do
not mean to intimate by this, my dear Pliny, that if
any new charge should be brought against him, you
should be less disposed to hear his accusers. l have
examined the memorial of his prosecutrix, Furia
Prima, as also that of Archippus himself, which you ·
sent with your former letter.

lr is with great foresight, Sir, you are appre-

hensive that the lake⁶ may be exhausted by being . Ι

connected with the river and consequently with the
sea; but, being 011 the spot, l think l have found a
method to obviate that risk. For the lake may be
brought close to the river by a canal without opening
directly into it; a sort of border being lest between
them to form at once a bulwark and a division.
