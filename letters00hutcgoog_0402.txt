Ι To rus Euri-:non Tasris

N vnruinrus Lurus, Sir, formerly a chief centurion,
was my comrade in anns; he was prefects at the
same time that l was military tribune: and it was
from thence my affection for him began. A long

acquaintance hath since mutually endeared and
strengthened our friendship. For this reasonl did
violence to his repose, and insisted upon his attend-
ing me in Bithynia, as my assessor in council. He
most readily granted me this proof of his friendship3
and without any regard to the plea of age, or the
. ease of retirement, he has shared with me the fatigue
of business3 and upon all occasions is still ready to
give me his assistance. Ι look upon his relations
therefore as my own; in which number Nymphidius
LupuS, his son, claims my particular notice. He is a
youth of great merit and indefatigable application 3
and in every view of his character, well worthy of so
excellent a father. That he is equal to any honour
you shall think proper to confer upon him, the early
proof he gave of his qualifications will easily convince
you; as his conduct as prefect of a cohort gained
him the full applausc of those most illustrious per-
sonageS, Julius Ferox, and Fuscus Salinator. And Ι
will add, Sir, that any increase of dignity which
he shall receive, will be an occasion of particular
congratulation to myself.
