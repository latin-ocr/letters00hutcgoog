BOOK X. xcvi

ἶ contumacy and inflexible obstinacy deserved chastise-

, ment. There were others also possessed with the
“ same infatuation, but being citizens of Romae l
directed them to be carried thither.

These accusations spread (as is usually the case)
ἵ from the mere factos the matter being investigated

ζ’ and several forms of the mischief came to light.
r:- -Α placard was put up, without any signature, accusing

a large number of persons by name. Those who
denied they were, or had ever been, Christians,
” who repeated after me an invocation to the Gods,

Ι and offered adoration, with wine and frankincense,

to your image, which l had ordered to be brought for
that purpose, together with those of the Gods, and

³ who finally cursed Christ—none of which actS, it is

said, those who are really Christians can be forced

, into perforrning—these l thought it proper to

discharge. Others who were named by that in-
former at first confessed themselves ChristianS, and
then denied it ; true, they had been of that persuasion
but they had quitted it, some three years, others
many years, and a few as much as twenty-five years
ago. They all worshipped your statue and the images
of the Gods, and cursed Christ.

They affirmed, however, the whole of their guilt,
or their error, was, that they were in the habit of
meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light,
when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to
Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a
solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds,butneve1·
to commit any fraud, theit or adultery, never to
falsify ‘their word, nor deny a trust when they

penalty on a Roman citizen, but must allow him to take his
trial at Rome. ef. st. Paul's “ uppeal to Caesar,” Acts xxv. ll.
