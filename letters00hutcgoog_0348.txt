Tun memorial of the Apameans which you
annexed to your letter has saved me the necessity
of considering the reasons they allege, why the
former Proconsuls sorbore to inspect their accounts;
since they do not refuse to permit your examination.

Their integrity deserves to be rewarded3 and they
must be assured for the present that you are to make
your inquiry at my personal wish, and with a full
reserve to their privileges

. To run Ewruaoa Taaraw

Tun Nicomediam, Sir, before my arrival, had
begun to huild a new Forum contiguous to their
former, in a corner of which stands an ancient temple
dedicated to the Great Mother.‘² This fabric must
either be rebuilt orremoved ; and for this reason
chiefly, because it stands on a much lower level than
the losty building now being erected. Upon iuquiry
whether this temple had been dedicated under
charter,‘² Ι was informed that their manner of
dedication differs from ours You will be pleased
therefore, Sir, to consider whether a temple which
has no charter of dedication, may he removed, con-
sistently with the claims of religion; for if there is
no objection from that quarter, there is none 011 the
side of inconvenience.
