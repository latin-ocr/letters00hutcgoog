bordered robe. The lots kept here for divining
sufficiently testify to the presence and oracular
power of the deity. Several little chapels are
scattered round, each containing the statue of a
different god. Each of these has his peculiar wor-
ship and title; and some of them, too, their own
sprIngs. For, beSIde the principal one, which is,
as it were, the parent of all the rest, there are
several other lesser streamS, which, taking their rise
from distInct sourceS, lose themselves in the river;
over which a bridge is built, that separates the
sacred part from that which lies open to common
use. Vessels are allowed to come above this bridge,
but no person is permitted to swim, except below it.
The Hispellates, to whom Augustus gave this place,
malntain a bath, and an inn for travellers, at the ex-
pense of the corporation. And villas wherever the
river is most beautiful, are situated upon its banks.
In short, every object that presents itself will
afford you entertainmcnt. For you will also find
food for study in the numerous inscriptIons, by many
hands all over the pillars and walls, ln praise of the
spring and its tutelar deity. Many of them you
will admIre, others·y0u will laugh at; but I must
correct myself when I say s0; you are too good-
natured I know, to laugh at any. F arewell.
