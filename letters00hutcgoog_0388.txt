To rus Eurnuon Turrim

You acted agreeably, Sir, to your consummate
pmdence‚ when you commanded the illustrious Cal·
purnius Macera to send a legionary centurionb to
Byzantium. Pray, consider whether the city of J ulio-
polis does not deserve the same regard, which though
it is extremely small, sustains very great burthens,
and is so much the more exposed to injurieS, as it is
less capable of resisting them. Whatever benefits
you shall confer upon that city, will in effect be ad-
vantageous to the whole province: soritis situated
at the entrance of Bithynia, and is the town through
which all who travel into that province generally
pass. ,

Tarum ro Pmuv

Tus circumstances of the city of Byzantium are
such, by the great confluence of travellers to it, that
I have thought proper to aid the magistrates with a
legionary centurion's guard as has been customary
in former retgns. But if we should assist the city
of Juliopolis in the same marmer, we should burden
ourselves with a precedent3 for other towns will
request the same aid, and the more readily, the
weaker they are. l have so much confidence In
your activity‚ as to believe you will omit no method
