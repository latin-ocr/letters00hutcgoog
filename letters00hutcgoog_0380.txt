by its being neglected, the whole house together

now scarce anything remaining of it, but the ground
upon which it stood. lf you shall think proper, Sir,
either to give or sell this spot of ground to the city,
as it lies so conveniently for their purpose, they
will receive it as the highest mark of your favour.

l intend, with your permission, to place the bath
in the vacant space3 and to extend a range of
colonnadeS, together with alcoves, on that part where
the former edilice stood. This new fabric l design
to dedicate to you, ογ whose bounty it will rise with
all the elegance and magnificence worthy of your
glorious name. I have sent you a copy of the will
by which, though it is not very correct, you will sce
that Polyaenus lest large sums for the ornament of
this house ; but those also are lost with all the rest ;
I will however make the strictest inquiry after them
that l am able.

which you say is untenanted, for the situation of
their bath. But it is not sufficiently clear by your
letter, whether the temple in the piazza was actually
erected to Claudius or not: for if it were, even
if it be now in ruinS, the site is preoccupate to
his worship.
