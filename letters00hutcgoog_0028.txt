applause by any speech that Ι ever made, as l did
here upon making none.

On the present occasion the little that 1 said for
Varenus was received with the same general appro-

Polyaenus reserved the case for the judgement of
the Emperor, whose inquiry l anxiously await3 for

must again renew all my toil and solicitude upon his

To Sarunurwus

Taouun 1 had very lately made my acknowledge-
ments to our friend PriscuS‚ yet, since it was your
desire, Ι willingly repeated them again. lt is with
great pleasure Ι see so much harmony subsist between
two such worthy men, whom Ι tenderly esteem,
that you consider your obligations as mutual. For he
professes also on his part to receive much happiness
from your friendship, and, with a very generous
contention, endeavours to rival you in that reciprocal
affection, which time, Ι am persuaded, will augment.
