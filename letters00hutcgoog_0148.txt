future division, whom they have supported just before.

But why do I talk like one giving instruction,
when l wish to learn whether or no these motions
should have been taken separately? My demand
was at least successful; neverthelesS,I ask, was it
justifiable? Would you know how I succeeded in it?
The proposer of the death penalty, overcome
probably by the legality, certainly by the equity of
my demand, dropped his own motion and went over
to the proposer of exile. He was afraid, to be sure,
that if the motions were taken separately (which he
saw would anyhow be the case), those for acquittal
would have a majority. And truly, the numbers
were far greater on that side than 011 either of the
other two, separately counted. The consequence
waS, that those who had been influenced by his
authority, when they saw themselves sorsaken by his
going over to the other party, gave up a motion
which they found abandoned by the first author, and
deserted, as it were, with their leader. Thus the
three motions were resolved into two; and of those
two one prevailed3 while the rejected third, as it
could not vanquish both the otherS, had only to

choose to which of the-two it would yield. Farewell.
