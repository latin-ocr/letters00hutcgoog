two years, Ι inquired oi this man whom he had

banished whether he had acquainted the Proconsuli* .

with his case? He replied he had not.

would have him sent back again into exile; or
whether you think some more severe, and what kind
of punishment, should be inflicted upon him, and
such others who may hereaster be found to lie under
the same delinquency. 1 have annexed to my
letter the decree of Calvus, and the edict by which
the persons mentioned above were restored, as also

the decree oi Bassus.

Ι wrm let you know my determination concerning
those exiles which were banished for three years by
the proconsul P. Servilius Calvus, and afterwards
restored to the province by his edict, when Ι shall “
have informed myself from him of the reasons of this
proceeding. With respect to that person who was
sentenced to perpetual banishment by Julius Bassus
yet continued to remain in the province, without
making his appeal if he thought himself aggrieved,
(though he had two years given him for that purpose,)
Ι would have him sent in chains to my Praetorian
prefects Ι’; for only to remand him back to a punish-
ment, which he hos contumaciously eluded, will by
no means be sufficient.
