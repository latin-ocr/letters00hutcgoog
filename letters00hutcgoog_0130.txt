grandchildren, than Ι do to have children; for
methinks as your offspring and mine they will in-

herit an easy path to honourS, a fairly well-known
name,and an ancestral tree of no mushroom growthfl
May we but see them born, it will turn our present
sorrow into joy. Farewell.

To Hierum

Wuau 1 consider that you love your brother’s
daughter with a more than maternal fondness, l see
Ι ought to give you my latest news* first ; that sen-
timents of joy may forestall and preclude anxiety.
Though Ι sear indeed, even after your transports of
gratulation you will feel some renewal of concern,
and in the midst of your joy for the danger she has
escaped, will tremble at the thought of that which
she has undergone. She is now, however, in good
spirits, and again restored to herself and to me;
already she is making as rapid progress towards
recovery, as she did towards her late danger. To
tell you the truth, she was in the utmost danger (be
it said without ill omen) ; for which no blame can be
laid on her, but a good deal on her youthfulness
To this must be imputed her miscarriage, and the
sad result she has experienced of not knowing her
condition.

But though you have not been vouchsafed the
consolation of a nephew or niece, to supply the loss
of your brother; remember, that comfort is rather

contrast to being aomar homo, the first ol your family to
attain curule rank.
