BOOK Vll. xi

state upon what grounds. For l wish not only that
you may approve, but that my fellow coheirs may
excuse me, for having in obedience to a higher duty,
separated my interest from theirs.

Ι have the highest esteem for Corellia, both as the
sister of Corellius Rufus, whose memory is most
sacred to me, and as she was an intimate friend of
my mother's. Besides, l am bound by a long-stand-
ing friendship to her husband, the excellent Minicius
lustus; asl was bya very close one to her son3 so
much so, that l fixed upon him to preside at the
games which Ι exhibited as Praetor. This lady,
when l was last in your vicinity, expressed a wish to
possess something· upon our lake of Comum; I made
her an offer, at her own price, of any part of my
estate there, except what came to me from my ·
father and mother3 for that Ι could not resign, even
to Corellia. So, when the inheritance which com·
prised farms in that district fell to me,l wrote to
acquaint her it was to be sold. This letter l sent by
Hermes, who upo'n her requesting him that he would
immediately let her have my proportion of the
estate, consented to do so.

You see how fully 1 ought to confirm what my
frecdman has done agreeably to my inclinations. lt
only remains to wish my fellow-coheirs may not
take it amisa that Ι sold what l was at
liberty not to sell at all. They are under no
necessity of following my example, since they have ,
not the same connexions with Corellia that l have.
They are free, therefore, to be guided by sels-interest,
amotive in my own case supplanted by friendship.
Farewell.
