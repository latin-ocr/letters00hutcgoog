BOOK Vll. ix

l know your main bcnt at'present is towards
forensic oratory3 but I would not for that reason
advise you always to wield the controversial and, so Ι
to say, militant pen. As landis improved by sowing Ϊ “
it with various crops in rotation so is the mind by *s
exercising it with different studies, l would have
you, therefore, sometimes single out a fine passage of
history, and practise epistolary composition. For in
pleading one has frequently occasion to use not only
the historical, but an almost poetical style for
descriptions; while a succinet and chaste style is
cultivated by letter-writing. lt is well also to unbend
your mind with poetry3 ldo not mean of the long
and sustained order (for that can only be achieved
by men of leisure), but those little witty pieces
which serve as proper reliefs to every degree of care
and occupatiori. They commonly go under the title
of alamannam but these amusements have sometimes
gained as much sameas works of a more serious
nature3 and indeed (for while l am exhorting you to
poetry, why should l not be poetical myself?)

“As wax by pliancy our praise commands,
Submissive shap’d beneath thc Artist’s hands;
Now Mars’ or chaste Minerva's form puts on,
Now moulds the charms of Venus, or her son 3
As not alone to quench the raging flame
Τὴε sacred fountain pours her friendly stream ;
But sweetly gliding through the flow’ry green,
Spreads glad refreshment o’er the smiling scene:
So, wisely ductile, should man‘s reasoning part
Receive the impress of each various art.”

ln this manner the greatest orators, and the greatest
men as well, used either to' exercise or arnuse them· N
