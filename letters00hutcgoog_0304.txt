my conduct can receive, is to be distinguished by so
excellent a Prince: l beg you would be graciously
pleased to add either the office of Augur or
Septemvir¹⁸ (both of which are now vacant) to the
dignity 1 already enjoy by your indulgence; Ἰ that 1
may have the satisfaction of publicly offering up those .
vows for your prosperity, from the duty of my office,
which Ι daily prefer to the Gods 1n private, from the
affection of my heart.
