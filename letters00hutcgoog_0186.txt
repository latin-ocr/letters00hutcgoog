To Maximus

l aava frequently recommended it to you, to be as
expeditious as possible in publishing what you have
written either in defence of yourself, or against
Planta 3 or rather indeed (as your materials demanded)
what you drew up with both those views: but Ι
particularly press this advice upon you aon> that l
hear he is dead. For though you read this piece to
several of your friends, and put it into the hands of
others, yet l should regret extremely, that the world
should suspect you only began after his death, what

¹it is most certain you had finished during his life.

Let not the character my friend has acquired of
lirmness and resolution be called in question. And
it will; unless both the candid and the malicious
shall know, that the death of your adversary did
not give you confidence to compose· this piece‚ ¹
but merely forestalled the appearance of a work you
were on the point of giving to the world. And thus
you will also avoid the imputation,

“With impious joy to triumph o'er the dead.'’ a

For what you wrote and recited on the subject of a
living personage, will be considered as published so
