To Mlxmus

Tim lingering disorder of a friend lately reminded ¹
me that we are never so virtuous as when we are in
sickness For where is the invalid who is troubled
by the promptings of avarice or of lust? Such an
one is neither a slave of love, nor covetous of
office; he disregards wealth‚ and is coutented with
ever so small a portion of it, as being upon the
point of leaving even that little. lt is then he
recollects there are Gods, and that he himself is
but a man; no mortal is then the object of his
envy, his admiration, or his contempt; and the
slanderous reports neither raise his attention nor
feed his curiosity ; his imagInation dwells upon baths
and medicinal springs. These form the sum of his
- cares and prayers ; and he resolves that if he ha's
the luck to recover, his life shall be passed in
luxurious ease, that is, in harmiess happiness.

Ι may therefore briefly lay down to you and
myself a maxim which philosophers endeavour to
inculcate at the expense of many words, and even
many volumes3¹ namely, that we should be as
virtuousin health as we resolve to be in sickness. ·
Farewell.
