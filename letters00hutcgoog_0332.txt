To ras Eusenos Tanis

Tau citizens of Nicomedia, Sir, have expended
three million three hundred and twenty-nine thousand
sesterces“ on an aqueduct3 but they abandoned
it unfinishcd, and it has actually been pulled down.
They made a grant of two hundred thousand
sesterces for another aqueduct, but this likewise is
discontinued; so that aster having thrown away an
immense sum they must incur fresh expense in order
to be accommodated with water. l have personally
visited a most limpid spring from whence the water
may be conveyed over archesl (as was done in their
first design), so as not to reach only the level and
low parts of the city. There are but very few arches
remaining; others can be crected with the square
blocks of stone which have been pulled down from
the fonner work; some part, l think, may be built
of brick,⁶ as that will be the easier and cheaper
method. But first, to prevent another failure, it
will be necessary for you to send here an inspector
of aqueducts or an engineer. Ι will venture to
allirm one thing-the beauty and usefulness of the
work will be entirely worthy of your reign.

⁰ opus testaceum, ‘⁴ brickwork‚’' was only used as facing to
a concrete core, as was also the lapis qrmdratos just ruen-

tioned. (Hardy.)
