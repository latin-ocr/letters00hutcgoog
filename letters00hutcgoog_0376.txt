LXVII

To rua Eurunoa Tanau

Tua ambassador from King Sauromates having
voluntarily stayed two days at Nicaea, where he found
me, I thought it best, Sir, not to dctain him longer:
firstly, because it was quite uncertain when your
freedman Lycormas would arnve, and secondly‚
official duties obliged me to set out for a different
part of the province. Of this Ι thought it necessary
that you should be iuformed‚ because I lately ac-
quainted you in a letter, that Lycormas had desired
if any embassy should come this way from Bosporus,
that I would detaIn it till his arrival. But Ι see no
valid reason for doing so any longer, especially as the
despatches from Lycormas which (as I mentioned
before) I was not willing to detain, would probably
reach you some days sooner than this ambassador.

To run Euruaoa Tnarau

Havruo been petitioned by some persons to
grant them the liberty (agreeably to the practice of
Proconsuls) of removing the relies of their deceased
relations upon the suggestion, that either their
monuments were decayed by age, or ruined by the
inundations of the rIver, or for other reasons of the
same kInd3 Ι thought proper, Sir, knowing that it
is usual at Rome to consult the pontifical college α
on such matters, to ask you, as the sovereign of that
sacred order, what course you would have me follow.
