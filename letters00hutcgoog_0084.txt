BOOK Vll. xxvii

This story Ι believe upon the affirmation of
others; Ι can myself affirm to others what l now
relate. Ι have a freed-man named Marcus, who
has some tincture of letters. One night, ,his

younger brother, who was sleeping in the same bed ’

with him, saw, as he thought, somebody sitting on
the conch, who put a pair of shears to his head,
and actually cut off the hair from the very crown of
it. When morning came, they found the boy's
crown was shorn, and the hair lay scattered about

on the floor. After a short interval, a similar ’

occurrence gave credit to the former. A slave-buy
of mine was sleeping amidst several others in their
quartem, when two persons clad in white came in
(as he tells the story) through ,the windows, cut off his
hair as he lay, and withdrew the same way they
entered. Daylight revealed that this boy too had ,
been shorn, and that his hair was likewise spread
about the room. Nothing remarkable followed,
unless it were that Ι escaped prosecution3 pro-

secuted l should have been, if Domitian (in whose r

reign these things happened) had lived longer.
For an informationlodged by Carus⁰ against me
was found in his scrutore. Hence it may be con-
jectured, since it is customary for accused persons
tolet their hair grow, that this cutting of my servants'
hair was a sign Ι should defeat the peril that hung
over mc.

Ι beg, then, you will apply learning to this
question. lt merits your prolonged and profound
consideration; and Ι am not myself an unworthy
recipient of your abounding knowledge. And though
you should, after your manner, argue on both sides3
