Tus Pompeian law,a Sir, allows the Bithynians to
give the freedom of their respective cities to what-
ever persons they think proper, provided they do
not already belong to any of the cities of this
provinceb The same law specifies the particular
causes for which the Censors may expel any member
of the senate. Certain of the Censors accordingly
have desired my sentimentS, whether they ought to
expel a memberis he should happen to be a citizen
of another Bithynian state. But l thought it
necessary to receive your instructions in this case;
not only because the law, though it forbids such
persons to be admitted citizens, does not direct a
senator to be expelled for the same reason, but
because l am informed that there are in every city
several members of their senate who are in these
circumstances. lf therefore this clause of the law,
which seems to be antiquated by a long custom to
the contrary, should be enforced‚ many cities, as well
as private persons, will be thrown into great confusion.
l have subjoined the heads of this law to my letter.

⁶ The rule thaha inan could not be citizen ol more than

one city was often contravenecl in practice, and difficulties ,
and confusion necessarily resulted.
