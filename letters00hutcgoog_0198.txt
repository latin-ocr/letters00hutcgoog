bay; the salient ridge upon which the other stands,
forms two. Here you have a straight alley
extending itself along the shore, there, a spacious
terrace that falls by a gentle descent towards it.
The former does not perceive the force of the‚waves;
the latter breaks thern: from atat you see th'e
fishermen at work below; from llus you may fish
yourself, and throw your line out of your chamber,
and almost as you lie in bed, as out of a boat. Itis
the beauties therefore these agreeable villas possess,
that tempt me to add to them those which are
wanting.-But Ι need not assign a reason to you; ·
who, undoubtedly, will think it a sufficient oue that
you are about the same business, Farewell.

To Auuunruus

Wuau Ι to begin praising you from whom Ι have
received so much applause, Ι am afraid Ι should

. seem not so much to profess my genuine opinion as

to confess my gratitudo Nevertheless I will not
scrupleto say, that Ι think all your productioris are
beautiful, but especially those of which Ι am the
subject. And the same reason will account both for
their deserving that character, and for my thinking
so: foras on theone hand you ever succeed best
when writing about your friends; so, on the other,
Ι always adrnire most what is written about myself.
Farewell.
