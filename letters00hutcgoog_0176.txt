BOOK VIII. xxiii

less pleasing and acceptnble‚ than useful, to the
several Consuls he served under! With what energy
5 and vigilance did he canvass for this very aedileship,
from which he is now prematurely snatched-a cir-
* cumstance that intensely aggravates my grief l

His wasted labours, his fruitless solicitations, and
the office which he only merited, never enjoyed, are
ever in my mind’s eye. That memorable investiture
of the laticlave under my roof; the first and the last
occasions of my supporting his candidature3 the

ι conversations we have had, and the consultations we
have held, all return fresh upon¹ my mind. 1 am
affected by his own youth, and, the misfortune of his
family. He had an aged parent3 a wife, who was
his virgin bride only a year ag03 a daughter, whom
he had only lately given a father's first embrace :a so
many pleasing hopes, so many tender joyS, were all
reversed and destroyed in one day! When he was
just elected aediIe; when he was lately commenced
husband and father, he had to leave his office
untasted‚ his mother childlesS‚ his wife a widow, his
daughter a mere infant, never to know a father's
love.

But what increases my tears upon this melancholy
occasion is that, being absent and unconscious of the
impending stroke, I never knew of his sickneSS, till
Ι heard of his death, and had no time to prepare
myself for this cruel blow, by previously apprehend-
ing it! Such is the distress of my mind as I
communicate‘these' tidings. You must not wonder
then that they are the whole subject of my letter3
for I am not able at present to think or talk of any-

thing else. Farewell.
