Thauri ro Pmrvv ·

Yon may without religious scruple, my dear
Pliny, if the site requires it, remove the temple of
the Mother of the Gods to a more convenient spot.
That you can find no charter of dedication, need not
influence you; for the ground of a foreign city is not
capable of receiving that kind of consecration which
is conferred by our laws

To run Eurnnon Tartari

lr is not easy, Sir, to express the joy Ι received, ·

when Ι heard you had, in compliance with the re-
quest of my mother-in-law ῦ and myself, granted her
kinsman Caelius Clemens the Proconsulship of this
province aster the expiration of his Consular office3
as it isfrom thence Ι learn the full extent of your
beneficence towards me, which thus graciously spreads
itself through my whole family. Ι dare not pretend to
make an equal return to those obligations, Ι so justly
owe you. 1 can only therefore have recourse to
voWS, and ardently implore the Gods that Ι may not
be found unworthy of those favours, which you are
continually bestowing upon me.
