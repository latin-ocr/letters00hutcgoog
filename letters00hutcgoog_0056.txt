BOOK Vll. xviii-xix

Your question proceeds from a truly generous prin-
ciple, but the answer to it is not very easy. Should
you pay down the money to the community, there is
a risk that it will be squandered away. Should you ·
settle lands for that purpose, they will probably be

neglected, as those of the public usually are. For
my part, Ι ean think of no better plan than what Ι
adopted myself. Having undertaken to give five
hundred thousand sesterces for the maintenance of
well-born boys and girls, l sold at that price to the
public agent some land of mine which was worth
considerably more3 he reconveyed it back to me,
charged with a yearly rent of 30,000 sesterces. By '
this means the principal was secured to the com-
munity‚ at the same time the interest was certain,

. and the estate itself (as it was of much greater value

than the rent charged upon it) was always sure of
finding a tenant.

Ι am well aware that Ι have disbursed consider-
ably more than the nominal amountof my gift,
since the value of this fine estate has been dimi-
nished by the encumbrauce with which it is charged.
But a man must rate public and pennanent‚ above
private aud fleetiug advantages and -study how to
render his benefaction most useful, rather than how
he may bestow it with least expense. Farewell.
