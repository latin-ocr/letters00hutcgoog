BOOK lx. ix

IX
To Coto

Ι causatu approve your being so poignantly
affected by the death of Pompeius Quintianus as to
keep alive by your regrets your love for a lost friend.
Far different from the majority, who love, or rather,
who counterfeit love to, none but the living3 nor
even counterfeit it, save to those whom they see in
the height of prosperityl For the unfortunate they
forget as quickly as they do the dead. But your
fidelity is perennial, and the constancy of your
affection can only end with your life· Quintianus9
most certainly, well deserved to meet with that
generous warmth from his friends, of which he was
himself so bright an example. He loved them in
prosperity ; he protected them in adversity; he
lamented them in death. How honest was his
countenance ! how deliberate his speech ! how equally
did he hold the balance between dignity and
courtesy! how fond was he of learning! how
judicious his sentiments! how dutiful his commerce
with a father of a very different character! how
completely did he surmount the difficulty of proving
himself a good son, without forfeiting the title of a
good man!

But 1 must not sharpen your affliction-yet Ι
know your affection for this excellent youth was
such, that you had rather endure such a recital, than
have his virtues passed over in silence3 especially
by me, whose applause‚ you imagine, will adom his
actions, extend his fame, and restore him, as it were,
to that life from which he is unhappily snatched. ’
Farewell.
