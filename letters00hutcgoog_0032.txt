BOOK Vll. ix

after'their manner, and at the same time, things ’
which you might have overlooked in reading cannot
escape you in translating: and this method will open
your understanding and improve your judgement.

lt may not be amiss when you have read only so
much of an author at once, as to carry in your head
his subject and argument, to turn, as it were, his
rival, and write something on the same topic3 then
compare your performance and his, and minutely
examine in what points either you or he most happily
succeeded. lt will be a matter of very pleasing
congratulation to yourself‚ if you shall find thatin
some things you have the advantage of him, as it
will be a great mortification if he should rise above
ou in all.
y You may sometimes venture to pick out and try
to emulate the most shining passages of an author. .
Such a contest is, indeed, something bold; but as it
passes in secret, it cannot be taxed with presumption.
Not but that we see many persons enter this sort of
lists with great applause, and because they do not
despair of themselves, advance before those whom
they thought it sufficient honour to follow.

Again, after laying aside a composition until it is ’

no longer fresh in your memory, you may revise it;
retaining several things but rejecting still more;
inserting a passage here, and re-writing one there.
lt is a laborious and tedious task, l own, thus to
re-enilame the mind aster the first heat is over, to
recover an impulse when its force has been checked
and spent, in a word, to interweave new parts into
the texture of a composition without disturbing or
confounding the original plan3 but the very difficulty
of this method readers it a profitable one.
