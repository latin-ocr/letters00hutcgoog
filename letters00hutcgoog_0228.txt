BOOK lx. xix

Yet hardly could I name a man, who had per-
formed such great achievements, so modestly re-
served upon the subject of his own actions, as Vir-
ginius was l can bear him witness (and Ι had the
happiness to enjoy his intimacy and affection) that I
never but once heard him mention his own conduct ;
and that was, in giving an acco nt of a conversation
which passed between him and luvius a: “ You well
know, Virginius,'’ (said Cluvius to him,) “the fidelity
required in an historiam you will pardon me there-
fore, Ι hope, if you should meet with any thing in my
workS, that is not agreeable to you.” “ Ο Cluvius,''
he replied, “can you be ignorant that what Ι did,
was done in order that you historiens might enjoy ’
the liberty of writing what you please ἓ ”

But let us compare Frontinus with him in that
very instance wherein you think the former is more
modest and reserved. He forbid a monument to be
erected to him, it is true ; butin what words? “The
expense of a monument,'’ says he, “is superfluous·;
my memory will endure¹ if my actions deserve it.'’
Is there less vanity, do you think, thus to put on
record for all the world to read that his memory
would endure; ,than to mark upon a single tomb-
stone, in two lines, the actions one has performed?
It is not, however, my design to condemn your
favourite; Ι only mean to defend Virginius; and
what defence can be more prevailing with you, than
one drawn from a comparison between him and the
person you prefer? ln my own opinion, indeed,
neither of 'thern is blameworthy, since they both
pursued glory with equal passion, but by different
roads; the former in desiring those monumental
honours he had merited ι the latter in rather choosing
the appearance of despising them. Farewell.
