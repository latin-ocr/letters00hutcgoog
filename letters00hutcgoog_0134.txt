BOOK VIII. xii-xiii

if not the only, i's however the prinpral instance
wherein I can be obliged?

But though Ι owed him no return, nor what I
might call reciprocity of good offices ; yet not only
the beauty of his extensive genius, as polite as it is
severely correct, but the dignity of his subject, would
forcibly invite my attendance. He has written an

account of the deaths of several illustrious persone, 4ι

some of whom were my dear friends. lt is a pious
office, methinks, as Ι could not be present at their
obsequies, to attend this (as l may call it) their
funeral oration; which though a late, is however for
that reason a more genuine tribute to their memories
Farewell.

To Geminis

l nucu approve of your having read my orations
with your father. Itis important for your progress
to learn from a man of his eloquence what to admire
and what to condemn, and ‚by the same course of
training to acquire the habit of speaking your real
sentimenta You see whose steps you ought to
follow3 and happy are you in having a living model
before you, which is at once the nearest and the
noblest you can pursue! Happy, ln a word, that he
whom nature designed you should most resemble, is,
of all others, the person whom you should most0
imitate! Farewell.
