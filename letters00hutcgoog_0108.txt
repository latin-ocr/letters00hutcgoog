Ι ouuaruv approve your design of writing a poem
upon the Dacian war,⁰ ·for where could you have
chosen a subject so new, so full of events, so
extensive, and so poeticaI? a subject which whilc it
has all the marvellous of fiction, has all the solidity
of truth. You will sing of rivers turned into new
channels, and rivers bridged for the first tIme,⁶
of camps pitched upon craggy mountaIns, and ofa
king⁶ superior to adversity, though forced to abandon
his capital city and even his life. You will describe,

subject is a vast and arduous undertaking even for
your· genius, though that is capable of the lostiest
flights and grows in proportion to the magnitude οι
Its theme. Something, too, there will be of labour
in reconciling those barbarous and uncouth names
