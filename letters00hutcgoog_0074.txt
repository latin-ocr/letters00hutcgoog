are going to speak or recite in public, it is only
the men who parade their studies that we are afraid
of 3 whereas in truth‚ those who say nothing about
them have so much a higher claim to regard‚ as they
pay the homage of silence to the noblest of em-
ployments. These observatione Ι give you upon
experience.

Terentius Junior, having blamelessly passed
through the military posts belonging to the
Equestrian order⁰ and held that of Procurator in
Narbonensian Gaul, retired to his estates, preferring
an uninterrupted leisure to the offices that awaited
him. He invited me lately to his house; looking
upon him only as a worthy father of a family and an
industrious sarmer, l meditated such topics as 1
imagined him versed in; but I no sooner began,
than he led me back to professional subjecte by his
cultured conversation. How pithy his every re-
mark! How pure his Latin and his Greek! For
he is so perfectly master of both languages that
whiehever he uses at the moment seems to be the
one wherein he particularly excels. How extensive
is his reading! how tenacious his memory! You
would think the man lived in Athens, instead of at
a farm-house.

To be short with you, Terentius has augmented
my solicitude and taught me to fear these retired
and soto speak rustic gentry‚ no less than the
most cultivated men Ι know. Ι advise you to do the
same, for, believe me, upon a careful observation,
you will often find in the literary as well as military
world, most formidable abilities concealed under a
very rustical appearance. Farewell.
