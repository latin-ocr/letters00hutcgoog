To Fuaox

You lnfonn me in the same letter, that you do
and do not study. I speak in riddles? Yes, to be
sure, till I express my meaning more clearly. Well,
then, you say that you have bid adieu to study3
but such an air of elegance runs through your letter,
that it is Impossible it should have been written by
anyone but a student; or else you are blest beyond
the rest of mankInd, since you can compose such a
finished work in your hours of idleness Farewell.

To Consum

'Trs extremely noble in you to deshe and insist
so vehemently that l should fix the price· you are
to pay for my estate, not at seven ‘hundred
thousand sesterces (for which sum you bought it of
my freedman),“ but at nine hundred thousand,
being the rateable value on which you paid the
farmers of the revenues for their twentieth partl
But I must destre and insist in my turn, that you
will consider not only what befits your character,
but also what befits mine; and will suffer me to
oppose your inclination in this stngle instance, with
the same warmth that l obey it In all others.
Farewell.

is, “you bought the twentieth part from tho tax-sarmers.”
