BOOK IX. xiii

Fannia ought not to be denied the privilege of
laying their grievanees before the honse3 and that
the point to be considered was not the ,rank of
the person, bnt the merit of the eausefl Cornutus
told the house, that as he was appointed guardian
to the daughter of Helvidius by the consuls, upon
the petition of her mother and her step-father,
he could not bring himself to abendon the duty
of his trust on this occasion. ln fulfilling it, how-
ever, he would restrain his personal indignation, and
report the extremely moderate sentiments of those
excellent ladies. They desired no more, he said,
than to bring to the Senate's notice the bloodshed
which Certus procured in his obsequiousness,⁰ with
the request that, if the legal penalty of his notorious
crime were remitted, at least Certus might be
branded with some disgrace equivalent to degradation
by the Censors.⁰ Satrius Rufus then expressed
himself in neutral and ambiguous terms. “l arn of
opinion,” said he, “that injustice will be done to
Certus, if he is not acquitted (I do not scruple to
name him, since the friends of Arria and Fannia, as
well as his own, have done so). Nor has the Senate
tythttlltlitttithigebrit lhlllolell
(as l hope 'and wish, and till something be proved

against him, shall believe he is), it will be in your
power to aequit him.”

Thus they delivered their several opinions, in the
order in which they were called upon. When it came
to my turn, l rose up, and using the same exordium as
appears in the published speech, l replied to them

and he might be indueed to degrade Certus if the senate
expressed condemnation oi him. (Merrill.)
