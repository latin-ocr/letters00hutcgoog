BOOK VIII. xiv·

Permit me then, notwithstanding the point is
determined, to go over it agam as if it were still
undecided, and to lay before you those reasons at my

they were delivered as conflicting opinions. Suppose
the sameperson had moved‚ that the freedmen be

proposals? How then can one man's vote for death
and another’s ior banishment, which could not be
deemed a single motion if proposed by a single
person, pass for such because it has two proposers?
