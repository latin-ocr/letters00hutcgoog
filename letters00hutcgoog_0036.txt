BOOK Vll. ix

selveS, or rather did both. The mind is surprisingly
, entertained and enlivened by these little composi-

tions, for they turn upon subjects of gallantry,
antipathies, quarrels, pity, politeness, and everythiug,
in short, that concems daily life and even the forensic
sphere. Besides, the same advantage attends these
as every other sort of poems3 that we delight in
prose after being fettered by numbers, and more
willingly employ what comparison shows to be the
easier form of composition.

And now, perhaps, l have more than satisfied your
demands; however, there is one thing which l have
omitted: l have not told you what books Ι think
you should read, though indeed, that was implied by
my telling you what you should write. Pray remem
ber to select with care the standard authors on eac
subject; for, as the'saying is, “though we shoul ,ι
readmuch, we should not read many books.” Wh
those authors are is so clearly settled, and so
generally known, that I need not point them out to
you; besideS, Ι have already extended this letter to
,such an immoderate length, that Ι have curtailed the
time, by recommending the course, of your studies.
Back, then, to your writing-tablets, and either write
something from the hints Ι have now given you,
or continue the composition on which you were

already engaged. Farewell.
