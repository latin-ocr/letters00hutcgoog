To rue Enrnnon ‘lanian

Venaruus Peuuruus, Sir, having leit me his right
of patronage over all his freedmeu,⁰ except one,l
intreat you to grant full Roman citizenship to three
of them. To desire you to extend this favour to
them all, would, l fear, be too unreasonable a trespass

, upon your indulgence3 which, as Ι have amply

, experienced, Ι ought to be so much the more
’ cautious in troubling. The persons for whom l

, make this request are, C. Valerius Astraeus C.

Valerius Dionysius, and C. Valerius Aper.

As itis very genereus of you to consult the
interest of those whom Valerius Paulinus has con-

* fided to your trust, l cannot but encourage your

good intentioris. Ι have meanwhile given full

s Roman citizenship to those persons for whom you

requested it, and have directed the grant to be

⁷ registered: Ι am ready to do the same for the rest,
ἒ whenever you shall desire me.

Roman citizens, become tull citizens thenrselves; lailing any
one oi these three conditione they gained only the partiul

³ citizenship known as the “Latin’' franchise, and were

called Latini thrriani lrorn the title oi the law in qrresti011
