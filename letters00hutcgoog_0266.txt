To Tnawountus

Ι an under a wondrous difficulty, which you must
settle. lhave not, lam told, a good manner of
reading verses: my talent lying chiefly' m reciting
orations, l succecd so much the worse, it seems, in
poetry. ldesign therefore, asl am to recite some

poems to my familiar friends, to make trial of my
freedman for that purpose. lt rs treating them, l
own, with familiarity‚ to employa person who ddes
not read well himself ; however, he will perform, l
know, better than I can, provided his fears do not
disconcert him, for he is as unpractised a reader as Ι
am a poet. Now the perplexing question is, how l
shall behave while he is reading; whether Ι shall sit
silent in a fixed and indolent posture, or follow
him as he pronounceS, with my eyes, hands and
voice3 a manner which some, you know, prac-
tise. But Ι fancy l have as little gift for pantomime
as for reading. I repeat it again, therefore, you
must extricate me out of this wondrous dilliculty,
and write me word whether you honestly think it
would be better to read ever so¹ ill, than to practise
or omit any of the weighty circumstances above-
mentioned. Farewell.
