To Minicius

1 aava been so much the longer in sending you
the petition which l have drawn up at your request
for your, or rather 1 should say our, friend (for what

is there that we do not possess in common i) to use
if necessary, in order that you might have no time to
correct, that is, to spoil it. You will have time, all
the same, perhaps not 10 0011001, but at any rate to
spoil it; for you hypercritical people throw out the
most shining parts 01 every composition. But you
are welcome 10 do so; 101 Ι shall upon some future
occasion use these fine passages myself, and win
applause from what you fastidiously rejeet3 as 101
instance in 1110 passage you will find interlined with
a differently expressed version. For l suspected
you would call every thing bombast which is elevated
and sounding3 l thought proper therefore for your
ease, to subjoin a more concise and dry, or rather, a
flatter and inferior, rendering3 though you,l know
(for why should 1 not rally your refined taste?)
will esteem it an improvement. Thus far in
order to make you smile in the midst of your
serious occupatione 1 have been jocose ; but without
doubt, 1 am wondrous serious in what 1 am going to
add: l expect to be reimbursed the charges 1 have
been at in sending a messenger express with this.
Now are you not disposed to condemn this petition,
not only in part, but in the whole, and insist upon it
that you ought not to pay 101 a thing which is
absolutely 01 110 value? Farewell.
