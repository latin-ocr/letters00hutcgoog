BOOK X. lxxix.-lxxx

· The Censors elect having desired my sentiments ’
upon this point, l was of opinion that, taking the
law of Pompey and the edict of Augustus together,
those who had held a magistracy before the age of
thirty, might be admitted into the senate3 because
the edict allows the office of magistrate to be
undertaken before thirty; and the law declares,
that whoever has been a magistrate, has a right to
be a senator. But with respect to those who never
held a magistracy, though they were of the age
required for that purpose, 1 had some doubt3 and
therefore, Sir, Ι apply to you for your directions. 1
have annexed to this letter sections of the law,
together with the edictos Augustus.

1 aaran with you, my dear Pliny, in your
construction3 and am of opinion that the law of
Pompey isso far repealed by the edict of the
Emperor Augustus, that those persons who are not
less than twenty-two years of age may hold the
office of magistrate, and when they have, may be
received into the senate of their respective cities.
But 1 think those who are under thirty years of age,

and have not held the office of magistrate, cannot,
upon pretence that in point of years they might
have done so, claim a place in the senate of their
several communities.
