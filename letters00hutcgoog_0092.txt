BOOK VII. xxxi

We served in the army together, and Ι had a
nearer view of his character, than merely what his
being my comrade gave me. He commanded a

division of horse, when I was appointed by the
consular Legate to examine the accounts of the
cavalry and the cohorts ;Ιι and as Ι found disgusting
rapacity and corresponding neglect in some officers,
so Ι found the highest integrity and exactest care in
him. He was afterwards promoted to high adminis-
trative offices; yet no temptations could turn
aside the innate bias of his soul from honesty,
no prosperity swell his breast; he preserved in all
the variety of posts through which he passed, an
unbroken reputation of humanity; and discharged
his toilsome duties in the same resolved spirit as he
now supports his want of occupatiori. He once
indeed quitted his retirement for a short interval,
with great applause, being chosen by our friend
Corellius as his coadjutor in purchasing and allotting
lands under the benefaction of the Emperor Nerval
And could there be a greater honour than to be
selected by so eminent a man, who had, moreover,
such an extensive range of choice?

Yon may believe how faithfully he reveres the ties
of friendship, from the dying testimony of many
persons,⁶ including that most respectable citizen,
Annius Bassus Pollio (who venerates letters as
well as every other valuablc art) keeps alive, and
spreadS, the memor-y of Bassus by the most grateful
eulogy, insomuch that he has published a memoir of
him. Α fine action, and the more commendable
frorn its very unconrmonness, since men in general
confine their recollection of the dead to what they
can complain about. '
