We went to the consuls; Senecio spoke what
was proper to the occasion, to which I subjoined
some remarks. We had scarce ended, when Massa,
complaining that Senecio had not acted from
loyalty to his clients but bitter animosity against
himself, desired leave to prosecute him for high
treason.⁰ The whole assembly was struck with
consternation. Ι immediately rose up; “Most noble
consuls,” said l, “l am afraid that Massa has tacitly
charged me with betrayal of my client’s interests,
since he has not asked leave to prosecute me
likewise.'’ This speech was instantly caught up,
and soon afterwards was the talk of the town. The
late Emperor Nerva (who while still a subject
remarked every worthy action which passed in
public) wrote a most impressive letter to me,
congratulating not only me, but the age, which had
been vouchsafed an example so much in the spirit
(as he was pleased to call it) of the ancients.

But be my action what it may, ’tis yours to heighten
and spread the lustre of it; not that l require you to
exceed the bounds of reality. For History ought not ,ι ¹
to depart from the truth, and the nuth is all the ξι
praise that virtuous actions need. Farewell.
