To Graurmus

Have you ever observed a sort of people, who,
though they are themselves slaves to every lust,
shew a kind of jealous resentment against the vices
of others3 and are most severe upon those whom
they most resemble? yet, surely tolerance, even in
persons who have the least occasion for clemency
themselveS, is of all virtues the most becoming. To
my mind, the best and most faultless character is
his, who is as ready to pardon the rest of mankind, 7
as though he daily transgressed himself ; and at the
same time as cautious to avoid a fault, as if he never
forgave one. Be it our rule, then, at home, abroad‚
and in every sphere of conduct to be relentless to .
ourselves, placable to others, even such as forgive no Ι
failings but their own; remembering always what ·.'
the humane, and therefore, as well as upon other
accounts, the great Thrasea used frequently to say: .
“He who hates vice, hates mankind.’'

You will ask, perhaps what has moved me to
these reflections? The other day, a certain person-
but of that when we meet—though upon second
thoughts, not even then, lest whilst Ι inveigh
against and expose conduct Ι disapprove, Ι should
act counter to that maxim Ι particularly recommend.
Who therefore,‚and what he is, shall remain in
silence ε for to brand the man would point no moral,
while to refrain is to take the side of humanity.
Farewell.
