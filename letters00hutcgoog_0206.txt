To Quanrarus

Tua pleasure and attention with which you read
my booksa Oa the Avenging of Helvidius, has made
you, it seems, more eamest iu requesting I would
fully inform you of particulars not included in, yet
relevant to, my work, and, in short, of the whole
course of the affair, as you were too young to
witness it.

When Domitian was kssledp I judged, on mature
consideration, that a glorious opportunity now offered
of pursuing the guilty, viudicating the iujured, and
advancing one's own career. Further, amidst the
many crimes whereof many had been guilty, none
appeared to me more atroci0us, than that one who
was at once an err-praetor and a judge, a senator,
should in the very senate itself have laid violent hands
uponasenator and ex· consul, who then stoodarraigned
before him. Apart from this, I had maintained with
Helvidius the closest Inendship that was possible
with one who, fearing the tyranny of the timeS,
endeavoured to hide his glory aud his no less glorious
virtueS, by a retired life. 1 had been intimate, too,
with Arria and her daughter Fannia,⁰ who was step-
mother to Helvidius. But it was not so much private
attachments as the rIghts of the public, indignation
at the crime, and the tmportance of establishing
a precedent, that incited me to action.
