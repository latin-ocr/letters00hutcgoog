BOOK X. iv

(my school-fellow and early companion) claims the
first rank in that number; in consequence of which
1 petitioned your sacred Father to promote him to
the dignity of the Senatorial order. But the com-

pletion of my request is reserved to your goodness;
for his mother had not then executed 0 deed of gift
of the four millions of sesterces which she engaged
10 give him, in her petition to the Emperor your
late father: ⁰ this, however, on a reminder from me
she has since done, having realized a sufficient estate
in land, with all the necessary formalities.

The difficulties therefore being removed which
deferred our wishes, it is with· full confidence 1
venture to assure you 01 the merit of my friend
Romanus, heightened 01111 adorned as it is, not only
by the liberal 01111 polite 0110, 11111 by his extra-
ordinary tenderness to his parents. 11 10 td that
virtue he owes the present liberality 01 his mother;
as well 00 his immediate succession to his late
father’s estate, and his having been adopted by his
stepfather. To these personal qualifications, the
wealth and rank 01 his family give an-increase of
lustre; as 1 persuade myself it will 110 001110
additional recommendation to your favour, that 1
solicit in his behalf. Let me then intreat you, Sir,
10 put it in my power 10 congratulate 1101001110,οῃ
011 occasion 00 highly agreeable to me; and at the
same time to gratify 011 eager, and 1 hope a laudable
ambition of being able to boast, that your favourable
regards 010 extended not only 10 myself, but also to
my friend.

⁰ Property 10 the velue of l‚200‚000 sesterces was a
necessary qualification 101 senatorial rank.
