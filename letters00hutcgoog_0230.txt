BOOK IX. xxrxxi

XX
To ernron

Tur: longer your letter waS, so much the more
agreeable Ι thought it, especially as it turned entirely
upon my works. l am not at all surprised you should
lind a pleasure in them, since Ι know you have the
same affection for every thing that belongs to me, as
you have for myself.

The getting in of my vintage (which though it has
proved but a slender one this season, is, however,
more plentiful than I expected) particularly employs
me at present. If indeed l can with any propriety
say SO, who only gether a grape now and then, visit
the vine-prem, taste the must in the vat, and saunter to
my town-servants ;who being now engaged in assisting
their rustic fellows, have wholly abandoned me to my
readers and my secretaries F arewell.

To Summanus

Youn freedman, whom you lately mentioned as
having displeased you, hasbeen with me ; he threw
himself at my feet and clung there with as much
submission as he could have done at yours. He

earnestly requested me with many tears, and even
with the eloquence of silent sorrow, to intercede for
him3 in short, he convinced me by his whole be-
haviour, that he sincerely repents of his fault. And
lam persuaded he is thoroughly reformed, because
he seems entirely sensible of his delinquency.
