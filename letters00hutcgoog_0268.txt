BOOK IX. uxum-xxxvi

XXXV

To Arruns

1 nava received your book, and return you thanks
for it; butam at present so much engaged, that Ι
have not time to read it; which, however, 1 impa-
tiently wish to do. Ι have that high reverence for
letters in general, and for your compositions in
particular, that Ι think it a sort of profanation to
approach them but with a mind entirely disengaged.
Ι extremely approve of your care in revising your
works; remember, however, this exactuess has its
limits: too much polishing rather weakens than
strengthens a performance. Besides, this excessive
delicacy, while it calls one off from other pursuits,
not only prevents any new attempts, but does not
even finish what it has begun. F arewell.

XXXVl
To Fuscus

You desire to know in what manner Ι dispose of
my day in summer-time at my Tuscan villa.

1 rise just when l find myself in the humour, ·
though generally with the sun; osten indeed sooner,
but seldom later. When Ι am up, l continue to keep
the shutters of my chamber-windows closed. For
under the influence of darkness and silence, Ι find
myself wonderfully free and abstracted from those
outward objects which dissipate attention, and left to
my own thoughts3 nor do I suffer my mind to
wander with my eyes, but keep my eyes in subjection
