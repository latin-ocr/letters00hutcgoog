To rue Enrraoa Tasris

Ι nscuivrn a letter, Sir, from Apuleius, a soldier
now in gari-ison at Nicomedia, informing me thot
one Callidromus on being detained by Maximus and
Dionysius, bakers to whom he had hired himself, fled
for refuge to your statue ι’; thatbeing brought before a
magistrate, he declared he was formerly slave to
Laberius Maximus⁶; but being taken prisoner by
Susagus 'in Moesia,⁶ he was sent· as a present to
Pacorus king of Parthia, in whose service he con-
tinued several years, from whence he made his
escape, and carne to Nicomedia.

When he was examined before mc, he repeated
this account3 so that l thought it best to send him
to you. But l deferr-ed his joumey while ,l had
search made for a gem which he said had been
stolen from him, upon which was engraven the
figure of Pacorus in his royal habit3 for Ι was
desirous (if it could have been found) of sending
this curiosity to, you along with the man himself, as
l am now sending a small ingot of gold, which hc
says he brought with him from the Parthian mines.
l have fixed my seal to it, the impressiou of which is,
a chariot drawn by four horses.

⁶ One oi Trajan's generals in the Daoian war.
⁶ A general, or ally, of Decebalus tha Daoian King.
