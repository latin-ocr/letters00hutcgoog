Ouu friend Macrinus is pierced with the severest
affliction. He has lost his wife; a lady whose
virtues would have made her a pattern even to
ancient tImes He lived with her thirty-niue years
in the most unintcrrupted harmony. How respectful
was her behaviour to him! and how did she herself
deserve the highest respect! How she blended and
unIted in her character all those amiable virtues that
distinguish the different periods of female life!

It should, methinkS, afford great consolation to
Macrinus, that he has thus long enjoyed so exquIsite
a blessing. Yet that reflection the more embitters
his Ioss; for the pain of parting with our happiness
still rises In proportion to the length of its con-
tinuance. l shall be in suspense, therefore, for so
valuable a friend, until he can bring himself to
submit to soothing treatment, and endure having his
wound closed—a process best effected by the sheer

force of necesSIty, by lapse of time, and by satiety of
grief. Farewell.
