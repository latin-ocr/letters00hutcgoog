Arnen your late sacred F ather, Sir, had, in a noble
speech as well as by his own generous example, ex·
horted and encouraged the public to acts of munifi·
cence, Ι implored his permission to remove to my town·
ship the several statues which 1 had of the former
emperors3 and at thesame time begged the liberty
of adding his own to the number. For these statues
had come down to me as family heirlooms, and Ι had
kept them just as they were on my distant estate.
He was pleased to grant my request and at the same
time to give me a very ample testimony of his ap-
probation.

1 immediately therefore wrote to the town council,
that they would alluta plece ol ground, upon which
I might build a temple at my own expense3 but as
a mark of honour to my design, they offered me the
choice of any site 1 thought proper. However‚ my
own indisposition in the first place, and asterward
that of your father, and later the duties of that post
with which you were both pleased to intrust me,
prevented my going on with that design But Ι
have now, Ithink, aconvenrent opportunity of makIng
an excursion to this place, as my months attendance
ends on the first of September, and there are several
holidays in the month following.

My first request then is, that you would permit
me to adom the temple Ι am going to erect, with
your statue, besides the rest; and next (in order to
executa my design with all the expedition possible)
that you would indulge me with leave of absence.
