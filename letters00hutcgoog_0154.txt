BOOK VIII. xvii

which seems invited and detained by the villas
upon its banks, has destroyed and carried away
much of the woods that· shade its brink. lt has
undermined mountains, and its charmel being
blocked by the resultiug landslides, it has wrecked
houses in the endeavour to regain its course, and
sullvevlellbgrlsl ihbltlllelblplahudblswho were out of reach of
this fearfulinundation, have seen, here the household
gear and heavy furniture of lordly mansione, there
instruments of husbandry, elsewhere ploughs and
oxen with their drivers, elsewhere again herds of
cattle let loose and astray, together with trunks of
trees, or bearus and gables of the neighbouring villas
——all floating about far and wide. Nor indeed have
even these uplands, to which the river did not
rise, escaped calamity. For long torrential taine,
and waterspouts hurled down from the clouds, have
destroyed all the enclosures on the valuable farum,
and shaken, and even overtumed, publio buildings
Numbers have been maimed, crushed, or buried by
such accidents, and loss of property has been
aggravated by bereavements

l arn extremely uneasy lest this extensive disaster
should have spread to you ; I beg therefore, if it has
not, you will immediately relieve my anxiety.
And indeed, l desire you would inform me though
it should; for there is little differenee between
expecting misfortune and undergoing it; except
that grief has limite, whereas apprehension has
none. For we grieve only for what we know hus
happened; but we fear all that possibly may happen.
Farewell.
