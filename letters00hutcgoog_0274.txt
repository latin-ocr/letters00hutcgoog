an entire new method with my tenants: for during
- the last five yearS, though 1 made them very con-
siderable abatements‚ they have run greatly in arrear.
For this reason several of them not only take no sort
of care to lessen a debr, which they despaired of
paying in full; but even seiae and consume all the
produce of the landa, in the belief that it would now
be no advantage to themselves to spare it.

Imust therefore obviate this increasing evil, and
endeavour to find out some remedy against it. The
only one l can think of is, not tolet at a money-rent,
but on condition of receiving a fixed share of the
produce; and then to place some of my servants to
overlook the tillage, and to keep a watch on the crops
And indeed, there is no sort of revenue more equit-
able, than what arises from the bounty of the soil,
the seasons and the climate. 'Tis true, this method
will require great integrity and diligent attendance

You see, it is not any pleasurable indulgence, that,
prevenis my attending you on the first day of your
consulship. Ι shall celebrate it nevertheless, as
much as if l were present, and pay my vows for you
here, with all the warmest sentiments of joy and
congratulation. Farewell.
