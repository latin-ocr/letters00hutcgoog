You will not wonder Ι so strongly pressed you to
confer the Tribunate upon my friend, when you
shall be informed who and what he is; and as you
have complied with my request, Ι may now acquaint
you with his name and character. It is Cornelius
Minicianus, who both in rank and character is the
ornament of that province to which Ι owe my birth.
His family and fortune are noble, and yet he
pursues his profession with all the ardour of a poor
man. He is a most upright juror, a most strenuous
advocate, a most faithful friend. You will look upon
the favour as conferred on yourself, when you shall
have taken a nearer view of this excellent person,

who (not to speak in too lofty terms of so modest a
man) is equal to all honours and titles that can be
conferred upon him. Farewell.
