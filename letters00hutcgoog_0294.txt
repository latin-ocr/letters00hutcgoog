freedom of Alexandrian before he was made free of
Rome. Ι confess, indeed, as I was ignorant of any
difference in this case between Egyptians and other
aliens, Ι contented myself with only acquainting you,

receiving from you a double obligation in favour of
the same person.

him the freedom of the city of Alexandria, as well as
that of Rome. And that your gracious intentione
may not meet with any farther obstacles, l have
taken care, as you directed, to send an account to
your freedmen of his age and fortune.

of me the freedom of Rome for your physician
Harpocras, Ι cannot refuse you this other request.
You must let me know to what district he belongs,
that I may give you a letter to my good friend
