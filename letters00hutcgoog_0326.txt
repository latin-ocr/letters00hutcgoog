Bithynia for the particular purpose of correcting
those many abuses with which it appearedftcbe
over-run. Now none stands more in need-of ¹re-
formation, than that convicts should not only be set at
liberty (as your letter informs me) without authority ;
but actually restored to the station of respectable
officials Those therefore among them who have
been convicted within these ten years, and whose
sentence has not been reversed by proper authority,
must be sent back again to their respective punish-

since their conviction, and they are grown old and
infirm, let them be distributed in such employments
as approach penal servitude3 that is, either to
attend upon the public batha cleanse the common
sewerS, or repair the streets and highwayS, the
usual offices to which such persons are assigned.
