Το Paumnus

Mauriuu differ in their notions of supreme ’
happiness3 but in my opinion it consists in the fore-
taste of an honest and abiding fame, the assuranee of

being admired by posterity, the realization, while yet
living, of future glory.⁰ l confessis Ι had not the
reward of an immortal reputation in view,l should
choose to live in the lap of Leisure, as people say.
There seem to be but two points worthy our atten-
tion; either the endless duration of fame, or the
short extentos life. Those who are governed by the
former consideration, must pursue it with the full
exertion of the most laborious efforts ; while such as
are influenced by the latter should quietly resign
themselves to repose, nor wear out a short life in
perishable pursuits: as some, we may observe, do, and
then sink at last into sels-contempt, in the midst of
a wretched and fruitless course of false industry.
These are my daily reflectione, which l communicate
to you, in order to renounce them if you do not join
with me in thc same sentiments: as undoubtedly
you will, who are for ever meditating some glorious
and immortal enterprise. F arewell.
