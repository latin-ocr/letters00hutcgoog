When I cited the jurorS, Sir, to attend me at a
sessions which Î™ was going to hold, FlavIus Archippus
claimed the privilege of being excused, as exercising
the profession of a philosopher. It was alleged by

some who were present, that he ought not so much
to be excused from that ollice as struck out of
the roll of jurorS, and remanded back to the punish-
ment from which he had escaped by breaking his
chains. At the same time a sentence of the Pro-
consul Velius Paullus was read, by which it appeared
that Archippus had been condemned to the mines
for forgery. He had nothing to produce in proof
that this sentence had ever been reversed. He
adduced, however, as implying his restitution, a
petition which he presented to Domitian, together
with honorific letters from that Prince, and a decree
of the Prusensiansfl To these he subjoined a letter
which he had received from you3 as also an edict
and a letter of your august father confirming the
grants which had been made to him hy Domitian.
For these reasonS, notwithstanding other crimes
were laid to his charge, l did not think proper to
determine any thing conceming him, without first
consulting with you in the affair, which seems to
merit your persoual decision. I have transmitted to
you, with this letter, the documenta put in by both
parties.
