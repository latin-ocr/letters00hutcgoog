BOOK X. cxvi-cxviii

upon some occasione, especially those of' public
sastivale, this kind of invitations may be permitted3
yet when they are carried so far as to draw together
a' thousand persons and sometimes more, it is going,
Ι fear, beyond a reasonable number, and has some·
thing the appearance of ambitious largesses.⁰⁶

ln is with justice you apprehend‚ that these public
invitations‚ which extend to an unreasonable number
of people, and where the dole is distributed, not
singly to a few acquaintanceS‚ but as it were to
whole collective bodies may be turned to turbulent
purposes of ambition. But l made choice of your
prudence, expressly that you might take your own
measuies for regulating the manner and settling the
peace of this province.

Tne Athletic victors, Sir, in the iselastic gamos,⁶
think they ought to receive the pension you have
established for the-conquerors at those combats from

their native city, in a chariot oi state, which was driven
through a brcach in the walls made ior the occasion. These
honours were originally confincd to victore at the four great
Hellenic gamas (the Olympia, Pythia, Isthmia, Nemea) ; but
in Imperial times it appears that any games could become, or
cease to be, iselastic at the Emperor’s pleasurc. Isalastic
victore had always received u pension, or irae rnaintenanee,
ior liic lrom their citios ; Trajan had increased these (proba-
bly daily) allowauces. (Hardy.)
