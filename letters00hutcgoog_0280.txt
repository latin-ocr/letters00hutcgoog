BOOK IX. xl ·

Ι meditate upon what Ι have dictated, and by often
revising it in my own mind, fixit in my memory.
Thus 1 have given you my scheme of life in summer
and winter; to which you may add the intermediate
seasons of spring and autumn. As at those times Ι
lose nothing of the day, so 1 steal but little from the
night. Farewell.
