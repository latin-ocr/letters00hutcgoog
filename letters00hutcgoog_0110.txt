BOOK VIII. Iv

especially that of the king hImself, to the harmony
of Grecian number. There is nothing, however, so
hard that art and industry cannot at least mitigate,
if not absolutely subdue. Besides, if Homer Is
allowed to contract or lengthen, or change even
Grecian nameS, and those, too, nothing harsh to the
ear, in order to make them run more smoothly In his

verse ; why should the same licence be forbidden to
you, especially since it springs from necessity and
not affectation? Come on then, my friend, and after
having, in right of your bardship, invoked the godS,
and among the rest that divine hero whose deeds‚
works‚ and counsels you are going to celebrate,
loosen all your cordage, spread every sail, and now,
if ever, give free course to your genius—for you
must allow me to be poetical too, when I am talking
to a oet!

Arill now I insist that you send me every part,
as soon as it has received your last finishing touches3
nay before, whiIe itis in its first rough andembryonic
state. You will tell me, that excerpts cannot please
IIke one entire piece, nor a sketch like a completed
design. I am very sensible of that and therefore
shall judge your work ns an essay only, and survey
It, as so many disjoined members3 and shall faith-
fully lay it up in my scrutoire, to wait your last hand.
Indulge me then with this additional pledge of your
affection, that you let me into a secret you would
wish kept from everybody. In fine I may possibly
admire and applaud your poems the more highly,
the more tardy and cautious you are In communica-
ting them; but the more quickly and heedlessly
you do 80, the more I shall Iove and applaud the
poet himself. Farewell.
