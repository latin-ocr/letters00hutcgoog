BOOK VIII. xiv

that it was impossible to put thern to the vote
otherwise than separately. For what is there in
common between a sentence of banishment, aud a
sentence of death? Nothing more, heaven knOWS,
than there is between a sentence of banishment and
an acquittal. (Albeit acquitting a person comes
much nearer to banishing him, than does sentencing
him to death; for both the former verdicts spare,
whereas the latter takes away, -his life.) In the
meanwhile, those respectively infavour of death, and
of banishment, sate together on the same side of the
House: and by a temporary appearance of union,
suspended their real disagreement. I demanded,
that the three verdicts should be counted as three,
and that two of them should not coalesce by a
momentary truce; consequently‚ I insisted that
members who were sor capital punishment should
move awaya from the proposer of banishment3 and
that those who would shortly be at variance should
not meanwhile group themselves in opposition to the
party for acquittal‚ merely to disunite again ; for it was
not material that they all opposed the same motion,
since they did not support the same. It also seemed
to me very extraordinary that whereas he who
proposed banishment for freedmen and death for
the slaves was obliged to put two distinct motions
to the House ; the proposer of a death-sentence upon
the freedmen should be reckoned along with him
who proposed to banish them. For if one and the
same senator’s motion had to be divided‚ because
it comprehended two dIstinct thingS, 1 could not
see how the motions of two different persons whose
views were diametrically opposed, could be taken
together.
